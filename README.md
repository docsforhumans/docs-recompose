# Recompose

[Recompose](https://github.com/acdlite/recompose) is a toolkit for creating composable pipelines of higher order components. It allows you to easily separate your logic from your components, creating re-usable building blocks. You can use it to drive your presentational components on any platform React supports.

Recompose was created by [Andrew Clark](https://github.com/acdlite), and you can find more information about it on [the official repository](https://github.com/acdlite/recompose).
